# Unity-Sha-Encription-Tool
A small tool that encripts strings.

It will feature a few encription types and a neat little copy to clipboard button.

This project is the baseline of all my other project and shall be my first feature complete release.
It will be one of the projects that will be using my Unity UI reposetory.

A webhook pushes notifications to my coding collective Discord "Crows nest Coding".
